# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running the given assessment.

Ruby Version: ruby 3.3.3 
Rails Version: Rails 7.2.1


Step 1: Create new rails application
	rails new string_calculator
	cd string_calculator

Step 2: Install RSpec and Add RSpec to Your Gemfile
	group :development, :test do
	  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 6.0'
	end

	bundle install

	rails generate rspec:install

	will create 3files namly:
	.rspec
	spec/spec_helper.rb
	spec/rails_helper.rb

Step 3: Check rails_helper.rb
	The rails_helper.rb file is automatically generated by rspec-rails and is required to set up your Rails testing environment. Ensure it exists in the spec/ directory.

Step 4: Write failing test cases, we need to create some files like
	mkdir -p spec/lib
	touch spec/lib/string_calculator_spec.rb

Step 5: Write the Minimal Code to Pass the Tests
	Next, we'll create the StringCalculation class and implement the add method:
	Create the lib/string_calculation.rb file:
	
	touch lib/string_calculation.rb

Step 6: Implement the add method and improve the logic as per the requirement.

Step 7: Running the Tests
	bundle exec rspec

Step 8: Improve/refactor if need.
